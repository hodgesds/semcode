# semcode usage guide

All semcode functions are git aware and default to lookups on the current
commit.  You can also pass a specific commit you're interested in, or a branch name.

**Note on Regex Patterns**: All regex patterns in semcode are **case-insensitive by default**. This applies to all pattern matching including function names, commit messages, symbols, and lore email searches. You don't need to use the `(?i)` flag.

**Branch Support**: Most query tools support a `branch` parameter as an alternative to `git_sha`. When you specify a branch name (e.g., "main", "develop"), it will be resolved to the current tip commit of that branch. Branch takes precedence over git_sha if both are provided.

**Multiple Repositories**: This server may serve several repositories at once. Call `list_repositories` to see their names and paths. Every query tool accepts an optional `repository` parameter to target one explicitly. If you don't set it, the server routes by any path argument you pass (to the repository whose working tree contains that path), and otherwise uses the default repository. The symbol-lookup tools (`find_function`, `find_type`, `find_callers`, `find_calls`, `find_callchain`) additionally accept a `repositories` list (e.g. `["narf","systemd"]`) to search several repositories at once and return results labeled by repository. When you pass none of these, unscoped symbol lookups use the server's configured default search set (shown by `list_repositories`).

**find_function**: search for functions and macros
  - git_sha: indicates which commit to search (default: current)
  - branch: branch name to search (alternative to git_sha, e.g., "main", "develop")
  - name: function/macro name, or a regex
  - also displays details on callers and callees
**find_type**: search for types and typedefs
  - git_sha: indicates which commit to search (default: current)
  - branch: branch name to search (alternative to git_sha, e.g., "main", "develop")
  - name: type/typedef name or regex
**find_callers**: find all functions that call a function or macro
  - git_sha: indicates which commit to search (default: current)
  - branch: branch name to search (alternative to git_sha, e.g., "main", "develop")
  - name: function to search
**find_calls**: find all functions called by a function or macro
  - git_sha: indicates which commit to search (default: current)
  - branch: branch name to search (alternative to git_sha, e.g., "main", "develop")
  - name: function to search
**find_callchain**: search complete function/macro call chain (forward and reverse)

  - up_levels: number of caller levels to show (default: 2, 0 = unlimited)
  - down_levels: number of callee levels to show (default: 3, 0 = unlimited)
  - calls_limit: max calls to show per level (default: 15, 0 = unlimited)
**diff_functions**: extract functions and types from a unified diff
  - diff_content: the string to analyze
  - Use this to determine which symbols are involved in a given diff
**grep_functions**: search function/macro bodies for a regex
  - git_sha: indicates which commit to search (default: current)
  - branch: branch name to search (alternative to git_sha, e.g., "main", "develop")

  - path_pattern: optional regex to filter results by path
  - limit: max number of results to return (default: 100, 0 = unlimited)
  - this only searches inside functions or macros, there's no need to escape
    your pattern to limit the search.

## Lazy Loading

To reduce the initial context size consumed by the MCP server (saving ~96% of initial tokens), you can start the server in **lazy mode** using the `--lazy` flag.

In lazy mode, the server initially exposes only 3 meta-tools:

**list_categories**: List available tool categories
  - No parameters required
  - Returns a list of categories (e.g., `code_lookup`, `code_search`) and their descriptions
  - Use this first to discover what semcode can do

**get_tools**: Get full schemas for tools in a category
  - category: The name of the category to inspect (from `list_categories`)
  - Returns the full tool definitions for all tools in that category
  - Use this to learn how to call specific tools

**call_tool**: Execute a specific tool
  - tool_name: Name of the tool to execute (e.g., `find_function`)
  - arguments: Object containing the arguments for the tool
  - Use this to run tools after you've discovered them

**Workflow**:
1. Call `list_categories` to see available functionality
2. Call `get_tools` for a relevant category (e.g., `code_lookup`)
3. Call `call_tool` to execute the desired tool (e.g., `find_function`)

## Recipes

### Searching for commits reachable from HEAD (or any other git sha)

If a repository heavily cherry-picks patches, it might have a backported commit
under a different git sha.  This means the most effective way to find the
backported commit is searching by commit subject:

```
semcode> commit -r "bnxt_en: Fix memory corruption when FW resources change during ifdown"
semcode> commit -r "bnxt_en: Fix memory corruption when FW resources change during ifdown" --reachable HEAD
```

❌ WRONG: reachable_sha=HEAD + git_range=HEAD~5000..HEAD
❌ WRONG: git_range=HEAD~5000..HEAD
✅ CORRECT: reachable_sha=HEAD only (no git_range)
